# 📝 PopSheet – Multiple cheat sheets while studying 

![PopSheet_logo_light](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90f7dfe8-09c8-4798-99fe-157b536fe306)

On 📝 **PopSheet** you have access multiple cheat sheets, one popup away, as if you had a small notebook while studying. Just hit the hotkey you chose in settings while you're reviewing and select the number of the sheet you want to check out. You can easily access your list of sheets going to Tools -> Popsheets and choosing which ones to add and which ones to delete. This is especially useful if you're studying to the SATs, MCAT, ENEM, JEE or NEET. Was inspired by [ChartPop](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/317566972).

## ⭐️ Tips before you get started
- Go to Tools -> Popsheets select a hotkey (W, X or Z) or use the default W hotkey.
- Upload at most 9 cheat sheets to the add-on (and if you want, delete charts 1 and 2, those are just samples).
- Keep the sheets inside the 700px wide, and if you don't want to scroll through the sheet, keep it around 450px height.
- Restart your Anki and start your studies!
