On PopSheet you have access multiple cheat sheets, as if you had a small notebook while studying. You can easily access your list of sheets going to Tools > Popsheets. It is recommended to have at most 9 cheat sheets, so you can fetch each one by clicking a hotkey (W, X or Y) and then a number (1 to 9), notes that go beyond 9 will not have any hotkeys of their own.
