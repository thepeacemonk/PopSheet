![PopSheet_logo_light](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90f7dfe8-09c8-4798-99fe-157b536fe306)

On **PopSheet** you have access multiple cheat sheets, one popup away, as if you had a small notebook while studying. You can easily access your list of sheets going to **Tools -> Popsheets**. 

## Tips to get started
- Go to **Tools -> Popsheets** select a hotkey (W, X or Z) or use the default W hotkey.
- Upload at most 9 cheat sheets to the add-on.
- Keep the sheets inside the 700px wide, and if you don't want to scroll through the sheet, keep it around 400px height.
- Restart your anki and start your studies!
